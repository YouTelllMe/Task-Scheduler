# Task-Scheduler
Begin by running the scheduler.py file. Then, type "help" for help.


Note:
- task scheduler hopes to allow users to retain past histories so does not
  delete notified tasks on its own and requires the manual clearing of finished tasks 
  (the clear_all option is convinient in that case)
- type "quit" to quit notification mode and return to schedule mode, and once more to exit 
  the program
- notification mode quits within 30 seconds of "quit" being typed
